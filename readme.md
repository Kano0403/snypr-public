<h2>This project not intended to be used for its original use, but instead to be used as a reference to assist in your own projects/programs that you may be working on.</h2>
This project is no longer being worked on and is now open source.

*In order to use, files containing Classes with viariables holding sensitive information must be created. These were not uploaded to the GitHub but instead made on individual devices for security (and adaption to different development environments). They are critical but not included in this release.*
